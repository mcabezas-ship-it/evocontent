    <h2>How EvoContent Boosted Organic Traffic by 45% for a Mid‑Sized SaaS Company</h2>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> GreyWave Analytics (pseudonym), a 200‑employee SaaS company providing data analytics tools for healthcare providers.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> GreyWave struggled to maintain consistent thought‑leadership content while scaling its marketing efforts. Its small marketing team produced only one blog post per month, and organic traffic had plateaued at 12,000 monthly sessions.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> GreyWave engaged EvoContent on the Growth plan (US$8,000 per month). The plan included four long‑form blog articles per month targeting high‑intent keywords in healthcare analytics, a bi‑weekly newsletter, ongoing SEO optimisation and backlink outreach. EvoContent’s AI platform generated draft articles based on keyword research and buyer personas, and human editors reviewed each draft for accuracy and tone. Technical SEO improvements, such as schema markup and page‑speed enhancements, were also implemented.</p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>45% increase in organic traffic:</strong> monthly organic sessions rose from 12,000 to 17,400 as new long‑form content ranked on page 1 for several targeted keywords.</li>
      <li><strong>30 new keyword rankings:</strong> the site gained first‑page rankings for 30 additional keywords, including “predictive analytics in healthcare” and “HIPAA‑compliant data dashboards.”</li>
      <li><strong>Improved lead quality:</strong> the bi‑weekly newsletter achieved open rates above 35%, and the sales team reported better‑educated, more engaged leads.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost efficiency:</strong> the cost per long‑form article averaged US$1,667, below typical agency rates of US$2,500–US$5,000【462816178449244†L169-L185】.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Client testimonial:</strong> “EvoContent quickly became an extension of our marketing team. Their AI‑powered process allowed us to publish high‑quality articles every week, and we saw organic traffic climb significantly within just a few months.” — VP of Marketing, GreyWave Analytics.</p>
    <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> AI and human collaboration enable scalable content production; technical SEO is essential for rapid ranking gains; and consistent reporting and strategy allow continuous refinement.</p>
    <p>Motivated by these results, GreyWave upgraded to the Scale plan to expand into video scripts and webinar content. They also began a link‑building campaign targeting industry publications to further enhance domain authority.</p>
